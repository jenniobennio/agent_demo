### Implementation Considerations

- **Layout Options**:
  - **Flexbox**: Ideal for creating a responsive layout with flexible alignment and distribution of space among items in a container.
    - **Pros**: Easier to center elements, responsive design, less code.
    - **Cons**: May require additional media queries for complex layouts.
  - **CSS Grid**: Useful for more complex layouts with precise control over rows and columns.
    - **Pros**: More control over the layout, especially for complex designs.
    - **Cons**: Slightly more complex to implement and understand.

**Recommendation**: Use Flexbox for the header, hero section, and footer for simplicity and responsiveness. Use CSS Grid for the "How It Works" section to easily align the three steps.
